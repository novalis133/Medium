*A visual exploration of the evolution from AdamW to MuonClip optimizer for training large language models like Kimi K2.*

This Jupyter notebook provides a simplified, interactive explanation of the optimizer evolution from **AdamW** to **MuonClip**, used in training the Kimi K2 model. Through visualizations and simulations, it illustrates key concepts like structural distortion, exploding logits, and the QK-Clip guardrail, referencing the Kimi K2 paper. The notebook is ideal for AI/ML engineers and researchers interested in optimizer design and large-scale model training.

## ðŸ“– Overview

This notebook narrates the journey from the **AdamW** optimizer to **MuonClip**, developed for training the Kimi K2 model. It uses Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib to create animated visualizations that demonstrate:
- Limitations of AdamW (structural distortion).
- Challenges with Muon (exploding attention logits).
- The QK-Clip solution and its transient nature.
- A hypothetical trade-off in multi-tool calling scenarios.

The content is inspired by the Kimi K2 paper, with references to specific pages (e.g., page 4 for Figure 2, page 30 for Appendix D). It aligns with my expertise as a Senior AI & Machine Learning Engineer, focusing on deep learning and model optimization.
